## ðŸ“¦ Architecture

- `AeonCore.swift` â€” main cognitive core, emotional logic, short-term memory
- `IntentEngine.swift` â€” intent detection and labeling module
- `Reflector.swift` â€” internal self-assessment and observation
- `SelfCoder.swift` â€” allows Lumi to save, compare, and rewrite code snippets
- `LumiApp.swift` â€” command router & integration core
- `LumiInterface.swift` â€” SwiftUI-based interface to interact with Lumi

---

## ðŸ§  Features

- Emotional context & reasoning
- Intent recognition
- Self-observation and summarization
- Self-coding memory (can track and compare changes)
- Lightweight interface with SwiftUI
